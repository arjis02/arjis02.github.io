      <h2>Concrete Random: The good and the bad</h2>
      <h4>June 4, 2015</h4>
      <section class="post">
        I've made it halfway through week-3 at DBC. And glancing back at my Gregorc Thinking Style strength and weaknesses, I would have to say that Concrete Random is almost spot on. I must admit that I am worried about a few drawbacks that this style may present in the future, mainly with peer pairing.
      </section>
      <section class="post">
        By definition, Concrete Random thinkers enjoy experimentation. I would say that this is a characteristic of mine that I take to the extreme. Sometimes I know that something will not work, but I choose to test it, just to see what does happen (as if knowledge of the outcome will be useful some day). This is why IRB is the perfect tool for me. I can test code and get the results quickly. I can see how people with different thinking styles could get impatient or even annoyed when pairing. However, I haven't come across that, so far, during my experience at DBC. But as the challenges get harder, I am curious to see how my thinking style meshes with others. The mandatory peer pairing has definitely made me more aware of things that I must continue to practice. I have been able to see how different people choose different ways to complete a challenge. I'm learning how to tailor my thinking style to complement my pair's thinking style.

      <section class="post">
        I do struggle with re-doing anything once it is done. I find it very tediuos going back to my old code and re-factoring it. I prefer starting from scratch. I see this being a problem in the future. And because I am frequently experimenting, I do find myself forgetting how I got an answer. Although this blog seems to point out most of the 'bad' with my thinking style, there is plenty of 'good'. And I plan to continue taking advantage of that. 
      </section>
      <section class="post">
        Experimentation allows me to try new things and take risks. And the result are great learning experiences. My mind is constantly coming up with ideas that I like to test. And if anyone I'm working with has any suggestions, I am more than willing to test out their ideas, as well.
      </section>
      <section class="post">
        With the growth mindset in mind, I would like to improve on some of the 'good' qualities of the other thinking styles. These include listening to others, bringing harmony to group situations, analyzing situations before acting, and following directions. I think the first step to having the growth mindset is to let your guard down and be comfortable with expressing when you don't know something. And I am completely comfortable with that.
