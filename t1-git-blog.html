  <h2>The Benefits of Version Control</h2>

        Version Control allows you to keep track of the changes you make to a file or project. If you are like me and make mistakes from time to time, it's always good to know that you have a safety net. With Version Control, you can go back to a version of your file that has everything you want without the things you don't want.

        Git is a Version Control System (VCS). It works by taking 'snapshots' of your data or file during your project's progress. To make this simple, I will refer to data as a file. Every time you 'commit' a change to your file, Git takes a 'snapshot'. Git recognizes the changes that were made. Thus, it knows when a 'snapshot' is necessary. This will allow you to trace your versions back to any time you made a 'commit'. This is why it is important that you frequently 'commit' your work.

        GitHub is a way to share your work with other potential collaborators. Unlike git, GitHub is located on the Internet. It is a host for Git repositories. One of the many benefits of storing your code on GitHub is that if you ever lose your locally saved code, GitHub will still have a copy. With that said, it's still good practice to backup your code.
