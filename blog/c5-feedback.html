      <h2>My Peer Pairing Experience So Far</h2>
      <h4>June 1, 2015</h4>
      <section class="post">
        Hard working and determined are great attributes one must possess for success when it comes to learning complex concepts. But we all could use a little help, sometimes. Support from others can help us learn faster and with less frustrations. Peer pairing has given me that extra boost in my education that would have made life a little easier when I first started coding. Two people working to solve a problem is definitely better than one.

      	My experience peer pairing, so far, has been awesome! I do feel that I pair better with certain people than others. But overall, every experience has been beneficial to my learning process. I know it is a good pair when my pair can understand what I am trying to say even when I have difficulty expressing my idea. Pairing sessions seem to go very well and swiftly when that is the case. I make it a point to ask each person about they're particular learning style before we begin a challenge. And although some learning styles seem to clash a bit, I find that I learn a great deal from the people that use different approaches to problems. I use what I learn from that person in the next challenge I have.

				I was very happy with the feedback I received. It was mostly positive and the advice was kind and helpful. One of the things I plan to work on is vocalizing my thoughts more. My mind tends to wander and go off on multiple tangents. This is why I refrain from just speaking my ideas out loud. But I was told that if my partner hears it, they may be able to draw some ideas from it, even though I may not.

				Writing feedback can be somewhat difficult at times. Especially, when the pairing went really well and I don't have any advice to give but to keep doing what they are doing. It is, actually, easier to write feedback when I feel that the person can improve on something.

				I really enjoy the pairing sessions. It gives me the opportunity to socialize with people that are in the same boat as me. And it is comforting to talk to people that are going through the same struggles. At the same time, they offer support and ideas that I may not have thought of if I worked on it by myself. I can confidently say that pairing has accelerated my coding education!
