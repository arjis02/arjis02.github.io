    <h2>Still happy with my decision.</h2>
    <h4>May 22, 2015</h4>
    <p class="post">
        My excitement continues to grow. After reviewing the video, DBC seems to be a good fit for my learning style. I started the video at 9:48 so I don't recall the reference to the 'Table' mindset. In the 50 minutes I watched, Shereef did mention the difference between the 'Restaurant' and 'Kitchen' mindsets. I specifically chose this type of school, as opposed to a traditional college, because I believe I can get more out of it than a degree. I, especially, like the analogy of the 'Kitchen' mindset because I do believe it is very important to work as a team. I am an extrovert most of the time and would definitely benefit from exercises such as the pairing sessions. I look forward to working with my cohorts during the on-site portion of the program because I tend to work better when I can bounce ideas off of other people.

        For the time that DBC has been around, it seems like they are doing a good job at tailoring the program to be most effective. Shereef mentioned how, through experimentation, the program has evolved. My expectations of DBC has not changed. If anything, I feel more confident in my decision to join. I am a bit nervous only because everything is so new. But that's also the reason for my excitement. I look forward to working with people who feel the same. I know there is plenty for me to learn. And I am extremely eager to continue learning.
