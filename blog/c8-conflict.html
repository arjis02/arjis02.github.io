        Personally, I do my best to avoid conflict. My natural tendency is to assume that people know what I'm thinking because I believe I would if I was in their position. After all, they should be considerate and understand what I am going through, right? Although this may be the case in some situations, this is not true for every scenario. Sometimes, people are so caught up in their own lives, they just overlook how what they do effects others. The fact of the matter is that there will always be conflict when more than one mind is involved. I tend to avoid conflict by avoiding situations where conflict is likely to occur. If that doesn't work, it's best to stop conflict from turning into a ticking time bomb by "nipping it in the bud."

        The last conflict I can remember being involved in was with a friend during a night out in beautiful New York City. Since we live in New Jersey, we decided to take the train into the city and just take cabs to wherever we needed to go. Upon arrival into the city, we took our first cab to our first destination. I took the liberty of paying for the cab ride. Then, we decided to grab a bite to eat. When the bill came, we both noticed that we only had credit cards. I told him that I would just pay for the bill and he could get me drinks later on that night. He agreed. After dinner, we took another cab to a bar. When the cab stopped, I looked at my friend in a way to signal him to pay. He glanced at his wallet and looked at me and said, "You got this?" At this point, my mind was gathering all the past situations I could recall where I felt like he has done this before. Then, the past two times that I paid for him popped into my head and I exploded with anger in the cab! I just could not understand why he felt it was ok to say that to me after all the times I had paid for him. After some confrontation in the cab for about a minute, he pulled out his credit card and paid for the cab ride. His defense was that he figured he would buy me drinks later. But my past experiences with him told me that I would always be at the losing end of this deal. Even though this situation was truly upsetting, I know it could have been avoided.

        There are a few ways I could have prevented the sudden outburst of anger in the cab. One of the solutions could have been to agree to have someone pay for something before the bill came. That way, there is no expectation build up and a decision could have been made before things got out of hand. The other solution would have been to discuss my concerns with my friend about his tendencies and how it upsets me. This would have made him aware of his actions and to make the necessary adjustments to preventing it in the future. All in all, this was a conflict with myself that I allowed to grow. From this experience, I learned that if something is bothering you, it is best to discuss this as early as possible to the person that is making you feel this way. By delaying this discussion, you open yourself up to more disappointments and growing anger. When you communicate your feelings at an early stage, both parties are of sound mind and can peacefully make the adjustments necessary to accomodate each other.
