      <h2>JavaScript as a Second (Programming) Language</h2>

        After weeks of Ruby syntax and concepts being crammed into my eager, but finite, brain, I was not sure how I would handle learning another language so soon. My initial assumption was that the languages would be similar since they are both considered to be Object Oriented Languages. In that case, it wouldn't be so hard to learn. After a week of learning JavaScript, I came to discover the difficulties of learning a second language.

        At birth, most of us are exposed to one language. And as we grow, we continue to learn that language to communicate. We see a dog, someone tells us that it is a 'dog'. This is our primary language. When we are learning a second language, we tend to use our primary language as a reference. Our brains already have a word in mind for a particular object. And that word is in our primary language. Now, we just have to remember the word in the second language that corresponds to the word in our primary language. That's fine and all, but what happens when that second language doesn't have a word that corresponds to a word in the primary language? Or vice versa? Sometimes a single word in one langage takes two or three words in another language to get the same point across. This is what I experienced when I started to learn JavaScript.

      <section class="post">
        Off the bat, whenever I think about how to write a single line of code, I'm already thinking of how to do it in Ruby. Then, I have to convert it to JavaScript. Sometimes, I unconciously write it in Ruby and have to correct it afterwards. Although I am new to programming and some JavaScript programmers may disagree, I believe Ruby is a more intuitive programming language. This is easily discovered when you first try to run your program and realize you're not getting the right output because you missed a semi-colon or parentheses. Maybe you also forgot to declare your variable. I've heard there are tools built into editors to catch these mistakes, but that's just an extra step that I would happily like to exclude. Then, as you continue to write a program, you start to think of how to incorporate a class. Only to realize, you don't create classes in JavaScript!

      <section class="post">
        Although these problems can be frustrating, it is mainly because my mind is constantly comparing it to Ruby. But just like learning a second language, the best way to do it is to practice it and, moreover, place yourself in an environment that encourages your use of it. The concepts I learned in Ruby can be applied to JavaScript. And understanding Ruby has helped me learn JavaScript much faster than I would have without it's knowledge. Perhaps I will get to be fluent in another language after all.
