        Asking a question can be frightening. You don't want to ask a "dumb" question. You don't want to give people the impression that you are unintelligent or that you haven't been paying attention. And although you constantly hear that "There's no such thing as a stupid question," you know in your heart of hearts that that can't be completely true. Well, there may not be stupid questions, but there certainly are questions that can be improved. And the best piece of advice that I received from my research is to look at the question you are asking from the potential answerer's point of view.

        Jon Skeet's blog on "Writing the Perfect Question" suggests some guidelines to form a really good question. He explains the importance of a good title, context, grammar, and including actual code. These are mostly tailored to questions posted on sites like Stack Overflow. But his "Golden Rule," which applies to any question you may have, is to "Imagine You're Trying to Answer the Question."
      </section>
      <section class="post">
        I took a look at all the questions I posted on Stack Overflow and noticed a common theme. I always made sure I provided as much information as I could to make the question clear. I made the title descriptive and specific to attract an answer. I wrote down exactly what I was trying to accomplish, along with the results I have already received with the code I created. This also shows the potential answerer that an effort was made, which, in return, will make a person more inclined to help. I made sure all the code was included, along with proper spacing. I read the question over and over, making sure to correct all spelling and grammar mistakes. And most importantly, I put myself in the potential answerer's shoes, pretended I knew nothing about the question, and made sure the question made sense to me. 
      </section>
      <section class="post">
        Because I followed these guidelines, I received answers very quickly. The first time I used Stack Overflow, I was pleasantly surprised with how eagerly people were willing to help. Sometimes, I would get answers that revealed a simple oversight on my part(using an 'unless' instead of an 'until', forgetting to set i = 0, etc..). These examples were very humbling. And although I made some "stupid" mistakes, I knew my questions were good because I got good answers!
