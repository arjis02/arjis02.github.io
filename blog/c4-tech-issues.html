      <h2>Beware of Hackers</h2>
      <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>
      <section class="post">
        As we continue moving forward to the "internet of things," online security will have to continue to evolve to safely handle all of our information. As all things become digital, securing our homes will involve more than just locking all of our doors. Although there are many benefits to this advancement in technology, it poses many threats to those who do not understand its vulnerabilities. Ultimately, people will fear using something that has the potential to expose things they don't want others to see or even manipulate. As new objects join the "internet of things," all of the things you use on a daily basis(washing machine, refrigerator, watch, vacuum, etc.) become a computer. And a computer can be hacked!

        Hacking has been a problem ever since computers were introduced to the world. But the internet has become the greatest tool for the common hacker. Our information is passed through Bluetooth, RFID, and WiFi many times a day. It is done through our phones, credit cards, and laptops. And most people don't even notice it. The benefits we gain from our constant connectivity distract us from the fact that we are constantly sharing our information with the world. On the other hand, hackers do see this and can take advantage of that. The video below is a TEDx Talk by Pablos Holman. He gives a little peak into what a hacker can actually do. And it may surprise you!

        These vulnerabilities make all of us succeptible to being 'hacked.' And those of us working in the tech field, developing new technologies that will be used by everyone, will have the challenge of incorporating security into their tech. This will continue to grow in complexity as more things become connected with the internet. But it is also necessary that all individuals become aware of what they are exposing every time they use such a 'connected' device. This way they can seek the proper security measures needed to protect the information they don't want to give out. Next time, you may want to read those privacy notices before you allow that app to access your information.
