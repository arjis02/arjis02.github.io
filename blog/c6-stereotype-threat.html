      <h2>Are women really that bad at math?!</h2>

        According to Claude M. Steele, stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. The first thing I thought about was how every female I've spoken to honestly believes that math is not their strong point. Come to think of it, I have not met one woman who has ever told me that she is good at math. Furthermore, most woman tell me that they hate math! This got me thinking. Is it possible that women, on a genetic level, are predispositioned to be particularly terrible with mathematical concepts? Steele's studies seem to reveal that this is not so.

        If, physiologically, women are not inferior to men when it comes to excelling in mathematics, why do so many women hate math? Stereotype threat seems to be a logical explanation. If someone identifies themselves with a group that is not supposed to be good at math, it seems completely plausible that that person has already realized his or her limitations and has, ultimately, accepted defeat before even attempting to achieve success. This would explain why my engineering classes were comprised of roughly 10% women. There were so few that in a class of about 500 students, we all knew the names of all the females. That may be a little bit of an exaggeration, but the fact still remains that there were very few female engineers in my class. But most of the women were highly intelligent, getting some of the best grades in the entire class.

        This is a tragedy, but I believe this is a problem that we, as a society, can overcome. The first step to solving this problem is to be aware of it. The fact that Steele's research was seen by me indicates that others, like me, are seeing his research, as well. And with the help of the internet and other forms of media, this message will reach even more people. Once we are aware, the next step is to break the stereotype. As Steele suggests, there are a few ways we can do this. I believe the most effective remedy would be to incentivize women going into the field of mathematics. I have already seen this with several web development schools. Schools are giving financial aid for female students to attend these schools. Although it may seem a bit sexist at first, it is a necessary jump start that our society needs to entice women to explore their mathematical capabilities. Another strategy would be to ingrain, in a young student's mind, the idea that women and men are both equally good at math. It is very important that this is done before the student ever conceives the notion of the contrary.

        Although these stereotypes exist today, I am very confident that, in time, they will be a thing of the past. As more of us become aware of the different identities that exist, the less these identity contingencies become a threat. As a result, we will all have the opportunities to truly be the best that we can be.
