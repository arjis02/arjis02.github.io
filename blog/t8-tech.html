      <h2>Description of Rails from a First Time User</h2>
      <h4>July 16, 2015</h4>
      <section class="post">
        Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. Now that I've stated the basic definition of Rails, what does that mean to a first-time user? Well, so far, we have been learning HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL. These are all languages designed to help humans tell computers what to do and also see what results are returned by the computer. These languages are powerful tools on their own, but the beautiful web applications you use everyday incorporate all these languages. This complex coordination of instructions and data given by these languages is made simpler by means of a framework design. The design I will be discussing here is Rails (more specifically, Ruby on Rails).
      </section>
      <section class="post">
        Rails follows the basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design. It creates a kind of a template as to how to build your application. Because of this, it works off of assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. The basic idea is to make the programmer's life easier by providing him or her with a fill-in-the-blank style form. Essentially, it limits the amount of code the programmer would need to write. Some programmers, especially those who are used to a different framework, may disagree with the design and argue that it inhibits flexibility. But the developers of Rails believe it does things the best way. And by eliminating monotonous code, it can make the experience of programming more fun!

      <section class="post">
        The Rails philosophy is guided by two major guiding principles:
        <ul>
          <li class="post"><h5>Don't Repeat Yourself</h5>DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
          <li class="post"><h5>Convention Over Configuration</h5>Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
        </ul>

        In order to get Rails running on your computer, you will need to make sure you have Ruby installed. You will also need SQLite3. Finally, you can install Rails by typing 'gem install rails' in your terminal. It will install a large number of files, which you will see after you hit enter. Once you have Rails installed, you are ready to create your first Rails application!

        You can create a new rails app by typing 'rails new <filename>'. This command alone will create your filename application and create a new directory that will automatically populate with files and folders that make up the structure of the Rails application. Here is a rundown of the files and folder created by default.

        Without doing anything else, you have already created a fully functioning web application. Your computer can act as a server! When you type 'bin/rails server' into your terminal and press enter, your application is live on your computer. Now go to your browser and type in 'http://localhost:3000'. The Rails default information page will pop up. You are now ready to create your own Ruby on Rails application! Of course, there is a lot more to learn. But this will get you started for now.
